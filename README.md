## My Journey to Becoming a JS Developer

My **'practice-layouts'** repository is a place where I document my journey from the beginning to becoming a JavaScript developer.
It serves as a platform where I can experiment with different web design techniques and learn from my successes and failures.

### _'Digital garden'_

This is my _'digital garden'_ where I write about:

- what I have learned,
- what I am currently learning,
- what I do.

As I continue to add to this digital garden, 
I hope to track my progress and gain new insights that will help me achieve my goals in the IT field.

Website built using Responsive Web Design (RWD) techniques, but without the mobile-first approach.
Technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3

#### what i learned ?
I learned how to create a flexible page layout by using the width: 100% property in CSS. 
This technique allows the page to adjust its size to fit different screen sizes while maintaining the aspect ratio and avoiding content cropping.
