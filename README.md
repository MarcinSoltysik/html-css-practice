## My Journey to Becoming a JS Developer

My **'practice-layouts'** repository is a place where I document my journey from the beginning to becoming a JavaScript developer.
It serves as a platform where I can experiment with different web design techniques and learn from my successes and failures.

### _'Digital garden'_

This is my _'digital garden'_ where I write about:

- what I have learned,
- what I am currently learning,
- what I do.

As I continue to add to this digital garden, I hope to track my progress and gain new insights that will help me achieve my goals in the IT field."
